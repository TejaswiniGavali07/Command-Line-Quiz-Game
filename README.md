Description:

My program is a command-line quiz game where players answer multiple-choice questions with a limited number of guesses. If players answer several questions correctly in a row, they earn bonus points through a combo multiplier, making the game more strategic and rewarding.
Players can also add their own questions and assign custom scores via the app's menu. All questions are stored in a questions.json file for easy reuse and modification. After the quiz, a live scoreboard shows all scores in descending order (session only).
Built using Python's core programming concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, file I/O, lists, and dictionaries
